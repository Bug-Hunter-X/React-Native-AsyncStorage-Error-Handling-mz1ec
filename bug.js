This React Native code uses AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data, but it's missing crucial error handling. If AsyncStorage throws an error during getItem or setItem, the app will crash.  This is because the `then` method is only handling successful resolutions and not rejections.  Additionally, the use of `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` can throw errors if the stored data isn't valid JSON.
